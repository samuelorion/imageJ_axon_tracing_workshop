### Aim 

Take images of labelled axons, automatically segment the axons.  

### Overview  

Using images of TH+ DA neurons, we will segment the axons, quantify the total length of neurites, and normalize this on an estimate of the number of cells in the image. If you so wish, you can count neurons manually. But, this is ineffective when we are trying to do experiments in 96 well plates*  

*or on samples where the replicates is high enough that we can actually detect changes (see my previous power analysis for required replicates in our system link).  

### Instructions 

Data for three images can be found [here](https://udemontreal.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Gr-LaboTrudeau2/Shared%20Documents/Lab%20Books/Samuel%20Burke/Shared_Data/TraceAxons_workshop?csf=1&web=1&e=b203BP).  

Download this data before we begin.  

Make sure you have the [Fiji distribution of imageJ installed](https://imagej.net/Fiji).
